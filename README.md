HackerRank difficulty today
I came across this [problem](/problem.txt) that I know I can solve and I have solved it [here](/problem_solve.py) using my own data.
The issue I had, was that I was unable to figure out how to pull the data from the input() using the given ['starter code'](/problem.py). The starter code is supposed to simplify it for newbies but I spent longer trying to figure out how to get the input from STDIN than solving the problem.
